      <h1>Experiences</h1>

      <h2>Intern at Samsung</h2>
        <p>
          I entered at Samsung in 2014 as an intern, after a long selection process. In my
          first day in the company I was challenged to create an Android application from
          scratch, even I had never coded anything in this environment. My strategy was
          divided my time in two parts: learn Android and develop the project. Firstly, I have
          created a paper prototype with the main idea of the application, I did it, because I
          had a short time and I could not waste time programming wrong requirements.
          Secondly, I modeled the entity-relationship of my database (I have used the Chen
          notation), at the same time, I created the class diagram. During my activities I
          have kept my focus to create a strong architecture, consequently I have applied
          some design patterns, following: MVC, Strategy, Observer, Method Factory,
          Singleton, and Active Record.
          In the half of my internship, my Android skills have improved, but not enough for
          accomplishing of the project. In order to finish my tasks and keep the quality, I
          decided to do overtime. At that moment, I have coded many hours per day, but I
          always kept my attention on my code appearance, documentation (I have used
          Doxygen), and the use of SDK tools instead of using IDE (I have used adb,
          logcat, ant, and vim as my base tools). At the end of my internship, I had to
          defend my project in front of many engineers that I have never seen in my life.
          Fortunately, everybody likes my project and I successfully concluded my
          internship.

        <h2>Intern, AEG - Brazil</h2>
        <p>
          AEG is a small company in Brazil, which provides business consultancy to other
          companies. When I worked for AEG, they needed a web system for handling their
          client's complaints and suggestions. In this sense, I was designated to create a
          software for this situation. Firstly, I understood the requirements and then model
          the system with UML diagram. I have created the system database with MySQL
          4.0. Additionally I had coded and tested the application written in PHP 4.3, and
          running under Apache 2.3.

      <h1>Academic</h1>
        <h2>Software engineering</h2>
        <p>
          During my undergraduate, I realized that my favorite subject is embedded and
          operating systems. As a result of my personal preference, I have taken many
          extra classes related to digital electronics and low-level programming (because of
          my extra classes I got a major in electronics). In 2012, I joined to the embedded
          system laboratory and I did a research with telemetry. In my research, I have
          worked with Samsung S3C2440 in bare metal environment.
          Although I have focused on embedded system, I studied many techniques related
          to code quality. Because of this, I passed through many different areas in my
          undergraduate as mobile, desktop, embedded systems and web. Nowadays I'm
          working in a laboratory called LAPPIS with Python 2.7, Ruby 2.1, Django 1.7,
          Rails 4.2, and Postgresql 9 in a national project. Finally, I keep my research in
          embedded systems, especially, I'm working hard with Exynos 5420 due to my
          researches with GPU in the embedded system environment.

        <h2>Exchange student at SKKU</h2>
        <p>
          Studied in SKKU (South Korea) during the 2/2013 and 1/2014. I decided to study
          in South Korea because of the excellence in embedded system, and because I
          dreamed with an internship in the Samsung Digital City. During my study in
          Korea, I kept my focus on embedded systems and operating systems.
          Additionally, I tried to improve my English skills and learnt a basic level of Korean
          language. When I was in Korea, I entered in the "automation laboratory" and I
          worked there around 6 months. When I was in the automation lab, Professor Jae
          Wook Jeon oriented me to study GPU in embedded systems. I followed his
          advices and I concentrated my efforts to understand this area and I did many
          tests on Arndale Octa board.

        <h2>Technician in systems development.</h2>
        <p>
          SENAC is an important educational center in Brazil, whose the goal is capacitate
          people to work in industry, services and tourism. In 2007 I entered in SENAC as a
          student of Systems Development, technician level. This course has 1300h and all
          the classes were held on weekends from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. In this course, I have
          learnt Java, PHP, database, UML, requirement analysis and other subjects
          related with information technology. My experience in SENAC has guided me to
          choose the software engineering field.
