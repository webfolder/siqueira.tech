Recently, I submitted a talk about VKMS in a conference named Linux Developer
Conference Brazil (linuxdev-br)[1] and got accepted [2]. I am delighted with
this opportunity, since I attended linuxdev-br 2017  as a complete newbie and
the conference provided me the required inputs to start working in the Kernel.
Also, I had the opportunity to talk with great kernel developers and learn a
little bit more with them. As a result, I have a lot of affection for this
conference; presenting at linuxdev-br 2018 means a lot to me.

In the talk, I will explain how I started with Linux Kernel and got accepted in
the GSoC 2018. Following that, I want to provide an overview of the DRM
subsystem and finish with the explanation of the VKMS. I want to detail some of
the features that I developed, and I will try to explain the features developed
by Haneen. As soon as I have the presentation done, I will post it here.
